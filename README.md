## HI

I am going to school for GIT Bachelors in Science. I hope to become an IT worker after I graduate!
I don't have a lot of coding skills but I enjoy learning how to code, and I have a bit of experience with game design coding.
My hobbies are video games and animation. 
I have a lot of experience in art as well.
